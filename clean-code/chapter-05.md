# Chapter 05: Formatting

- Code formatting is about communication.
- Code should be read from left to right and top to bottom.
- Each line is an expression, and a group of lines represents a complete thought.
  - These should be separated with other complete thoughts by a blank line.
- If one function calls another, they should be vertically close.
- Declare temporary variables close to where they are being used.
- Avoid long files > 2000 and wide code lines (splitting them up into multiple lines is better).
- Indent the lines of source code in proportion to their position in the hierarchy of the code file.
  - This clearly shows the variables, constructors, methods, etc.
  - Avoid the temptation to collapse short 'if' or 'while' statements
