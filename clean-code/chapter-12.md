# Chapter 12: Emergence

According to Kent Beck, there are 4 rules for getting clean code via emergent design:

1. Runs all the tests.
- System must act as intended.

2. Contains no duplication.
- Duplication brings additional work.

3. Expresses the intent of the programmer.
- Expressive code to facilitate maintenance (ties in with writing meaningful variable names, clean functions and classes, good foundational system structure, etc.)

4. Minimizes the number of classes and methods.
